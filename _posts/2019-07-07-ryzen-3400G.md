If you keep up with tech news, you would've heard that AMD has recently released their 3000-series CPUs along with their Navi series GPUs. The new line of Ryzen CPUs boasts a whole new and improved set of CPUs with increased cores, clock speeds, cache sizes, over-clocking headroom, and more.

However, in this post we look at one CPU in particular... **The Ryzen 3400G**.
A few months ago prior to this post I built [a "cheap" (£300) gaming/work PC](/2019-06-12-how-to-build-a-budget-pc-for-gaming-and-work/) which was powered by the Ryzen 5 2400G. A powerful APU was essential in order to build a PC that could game, without having to buy a graphics card (and therefore save money).

### Recent Ryzen 5 2400G owners, should we have waited for the 3400G?
Being quite desperate to build my first gaming/work PC (The other reason, was that I needed to get some work done as well), I decided to bite the bullet and purchse the Ryzen 5 2400G for ~£120. Should I have just waited?
