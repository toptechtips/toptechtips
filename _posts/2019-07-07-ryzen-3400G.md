If you keep up with tech news, you would've heard that AMD has recently released their 3000-series CPUs along with their Navi series GPUs. The new line of Ryzen CPUs boasts a whole new and improved set of CPUs with increased cores, clock speeds, cache sizes, over-clocking headroom, and more.

However, in this post we look at one CPU in particular... **The Ryzen 3400G**.
A few months ago prior to this post I built [a "cheap" (£300) gaming/work PC](/2019-06-12-how-to-build-a-budget-pc-for-gaming-and-work/) which was powered by the Ryzen 5 2400G. A powerful APU was essential in order to build a PC that could game, without having to buy a graphics card (and therefore save money).

### Recent Ryzen 5 2400G owners, should we have waited for the 3400G?
Being quite desperate to build my first gaming/work PC (The other reason, was that I needed to get some work done as well), I decided to bite the bullet and purchase the Ryzen 5 2400G for ~£120. Should I have just waited?

### Conslusion
I've thrown all the stats I've found around the internet, and it's obvious that the Ryzen 3400G has good improvement over the 2400G. Looking at the gaming performance though, Ryzen 3400G isn't too far off from the Ryzen 2400G.

_If you've already bought a Ryzen 2400G, I'd personally not worry about paying the extra ~£20 to upgrade (most likely more. I bought my Ryzen 2400G for £117, highly doubt I could sell it at that price)._

Having said that, if you haven't already bought an APU and you want the most powerful Integrated Graphics there is whilst being affordable, then by all means go for the 3400G. You can also wait a little until the price of the 3400G drops a little.
