Welcome to my first blog post!

Throughout the years, computing power has continued to increase whilst "price-per-performance” continues to decrease. There has never been a better time to build a computer!

> If this is your first time building a computer, do not fret! This build was also **my first ever computer build** and for once, I didn't break anything!

<br>

#### _Are current budget gaming builds worth it?_

**Pros**
* Very affordable
* Can play some of the current cpu/intensive games. For example - [Ryzen 5 2400G Vega 11 - 1440p Gaming in 11 Games - Benchmark Test](https://youtu.be/8cz4EkAFOWs) and [Ryzen 5 2400GE vs. Ryzen 5 2400G in 9 Games. Gaming Benchmark Test Comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6CbJl_Zyg)
* Doesn’t consume a lot of power

**Cons**
* Most top-end games will probably be restricted to 30-60FPS, at low quality and low resolutions 720-1080p

### What you need
#### CPU, Video Card (GPU) & CPU Cooler
Normally, most would purchase a CPU and a dedicated video/graphics card separately. However, with AMD's latest APUs, integrated graphics has never been more powerful!
