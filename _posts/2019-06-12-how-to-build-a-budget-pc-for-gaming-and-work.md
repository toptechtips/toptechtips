**Note:** Post is still under construction


Welcome to my first blog post!

Throughout the years, computing power has continued to increase whilst "price-per-performance” continues to decrease. There has never been a better time to build a computer!

If this is your first time building a computer, do not fret! This build was also my first ever computer build and for once, I didn't break anything!

<br>

### Are current budget gaming builds worth it?

| Pros        | Cons           |
| :------------- |:-----------------|
| Can actually play some of the current cpu/intensive games (See Example below) | Most top-end games will probably be restricted to 30-60FPS, at low quality and low resolutions 720-1080p |
| Doesn’t consume a lot of power     |     |
|Very affordable |     |

Example - [Ryzen 5 2400G Vega 11 - 1440p Gaming in 11 Games - Benchmark Test](https://youtu.be/8cz4EkAFOWs) and [Ryzen 5 2400GE vs. Ryzen 5 2400G in 9 Games. Gaming Benchmark Test Comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6CbJl_Zyg)

<br>

### What you need

#### 1. CPU, Video Card (GPU) & CPU Cooler
Normally, most would purchase a CPU and a dedicated video/graphics card separately. However, with AMD's latest APUs, integrated graphics has never been more powerful!

If possible, I'd recommend spending the extra £40 and getting the Ryzen 5 2400G because:
* More Threads and better multi-core performance
* higher cpu benchmark scores - [Ryzen 5 2400G benchmark comparison](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-ryzen-3-2200-g-ryzen-5-2400g-review)
* Better gaming performance - [Ryzen 2400G vs 2200G games test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I74BOOf7BVY)


The GPU performance of Ryzen 2400G is comparable (and sometimes better) than Nvidia's GT 1030 (£60+). Obviously, you won't be able to play most GPU intensive games past Low/720p settings at 40+ fps.

If you want to get quite a bit more performance, the next step up would be AMD's RX 5 series or Nvidia's 1050 upwards, which all start at £100+, but lets be honest - at this point you'd probably rather spend a bit more as you want to play you games at max, if not high settings.

Alternatively, **you could buy a pre-owned older generation graphics card** like the GTX 960+, AMD's R9 series as their performance are closer to GTX 1050 Ti's and AMD's RX570 and RX580 (£100-150) whilst spending less than £60!

Another Benefit with buying an **AMD Ryzen is that they come with a stock cooler**, saving you around £20

#### 2. Motherboard
Fortunately, there are a lot of micro-ATX sized socket AM4 Motherboards that can be bought for less than £60 - Perfect for budget builds!

One of the cheapest I can recommend is the ASRock A320M-HDV which comes in at £41. However, it may be worth adding an extra £20+ to buy a motherboard with better features and capabilities for future upgrades.

> Some motherboards have better overclocking capabilities than others, so do look into that if you want to look into overclocking.

#### 3. RAM
The current latest type of RAM available is DDR4, which boasts higher clock speed frequencies, better performance whilst reducing power consumption.

For a gaming build you should have at least 8GB of RAM, although I would recommend 16GB. The Ryzen APU listed above takes up to 2GB of the RAM and uses it as graphics memory. Leaving you with 6GB of RAM to run your Operating System and play your game.

A lot of modern game consume can a lot of graphics memory and RAM which can actually bottleneck gaming performance. To prove my point - when I first built my PC (using my recommended parts list) I had opted for 8GB of Corsair DDR4 2400Mhz RAM. I tried to play [Tom Clancy's division 2](https://tomclancy-thedivision.ubisoft.com/game/sv-se/home) at lowest settings at 720p. I was struggling to achieve higher than 30-40fps... and the frame drops were quite annoying.

I also benchmarked my AMD Ryzen 2400G with [Unigine Heaven](https://benchmark.unigine.com/heaven) and was scroing less than 1800. After upgrading to 16GB Corsair DDR4 3000MHz RAM, I was easily scoring over 3000 and was able to get 50-60FPS consistently on Tom Clancy's division 2 and was even able to play at 1080p.

There are other factors to consider, like RAM Timings and RAM CAS Latency, but for now we will keep it simple and stick with the basics. Here's an awesome [guide to choosing RAM](https://www.gamingscan.com/how-to-choose-ram/)

#### Storage
There are many types of storage devices out there but to keep things simple, the 3 major ones are Hard Disks, SSDs or m.2 SATA and m.2 NVMe.

> M.2 – A slimmer form factor for storage drives <br>
> NVMe – A protocol that lets data be read and written via PCI-E <br>
> SATA 3 – An older protocol that is typically not as fast as NVMe

Hard Disks are the slowest of them all, but also the cheapest of them all. HDDs normally come in 3.5" and 2.5" (normally laptops) form factors. A 7200 RPM Hard Drive has an average sequential read/write speed of 80-160MB/second

SSDs, unlike HDDs have no moving parts hence are quieter. They normally come in 2.5" form factor and are more durable and use less energy. Having said this, they tend to have a lower max capacity and are much more expensive than HDDs per GB.

If you're not convinced SSDs are a hell of a lot better, check [this](https://windows101tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Comparision-between-HDD-Vs.-SSD-.jpg?escpb=184-0&ezimgfmt=rs:590x863/rscb0/ng:webp/ngcb0) out. A SATA 3 SSD has an average sequential read/write speed up to 550MB/second

m.2 SATA is performs like an SSD but benefits from the it's tiny m.2 size meaning the drive directly plugs into the motherboard - no messy cabling! Their pricing is also similar to SSDs

m.2 NVMe are the fastest of the 3, and also the most expensive. They also have the highest random IO read/write speed (as supposed to sequential read/write speeds). A NVME SSD has an average sequential read/write speed up to 3500MB/second

For the cheapest option, one 1TB hard drive would be enough, but for gaming and that extra speed I would highly recommend SSD. One of the most popular practices is to have either an  120GB - 500GB SSD (2.5" or m.2 form factor) or NVMe for installing the Operating system and applications and programs, whilst another 1TB+ HDD is used for saving larger files like games and media.

#### Power Supply
The Power Supply Unit (PSU) is what will supply your whole computer with power. It's important that you choose a power supply with the correct Wattage. Another factor to consider when choosing a power supply is the efficiency.

> "A power supply with an efficiency rating of 80 percent provides 80 percent of its rated wattage as power to your system, while losing the other 20 percent as heat."
<br>
~ [PC Wolrd](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2025425/how-to-pick-the-best-pc-power-supply.html)

Most modern PSUs tend be "80 Plus" certified confirming that those PSUs are at least 80% efficient. However, within the "80 Plus" range there are different efficiency tiers - Bronze, Silver, Gold & Platinum and can be very expensive.

For our goals, a normal 80 Plus or Bronze-tier PSU rated at 450W will suffice. However, I recommend the extra wattage for a little more cost. It saves you from having to buy another PSU if you decided to upgrade your PC.

Check this [power supply calculator](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) or see the estimated wattage when building with [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/).
