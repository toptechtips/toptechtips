Welcome to my first blog post!

Throughout the years, computing power has continued to increase whilst "price-per-performance” continues to decrease. There has never been a better time to build a computer!

If this is your first time building a computer, do not fret! This build was also **my first ever computer build** and for once, I didn't break anything!

<br>

### Are current budget gaming builds worth it?

**Pros**
* Very affordable
* Can play some of the current cpu/intensive games. For example - [Ryzen 5 2400G Vega 11 - 1440p Gaming in 11 Games - Benchmark Test](https://youtu.be/8cz4EkAFOWs) and [Ryzen 5 2400GE vs. Ryzen 5 2400G in 9 Games. Gaming Benchmark Test Comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6CbJl_Zyg)
* Doesn’t consume a lot of power

**Cons**
* Most top-end games will probably be restricted to 30-60FPS, at low quality and low resolutions 720-1080p

### What you need

#### 1. CPU, Video Card (GPU) & CPU Cooler
Normally, most would purchase a CPU and a dedicated video/graphics card separately. However, with AMD's latest APUs, integrated graphics has never been more powerful!

If possible, I'd recommend spending the extra £40 and getting the Ryzen 5 2400G because:
* More Threads and better multi-core performance
* higher cpu benchmark scores - [Ryzen 5 2400G benchmark comparison](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-ryzen-3-2200-g-ryzen-5-2400g-review)
* Better gaming performance - [Ryzen 2400G vs 2200G games test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I74BOOf7BVY)


The GPU performance of Ryzen 2400G is comparable (and sometimes better) than Nvidia's GT 1030 (£60+). Obviously, you won't be able to play most GPU intensive games past Low/720p settings at 40+ fps.

If you want to get quite a bit more performance, the next step up would be AMD's RX 5 series or Nvidia's 1050 upwards, which all start at £100+, but lets be honest - at this point you'd probably rather spend a bit more as you want to play you games at max, if not high settings.

Alternatively, **you could buy a pre-owned older generation graphics card** like the GTX 960+, AMD's R9 series as their performance are closer to GTX 1050 Ti's and AMD's RX570 and RX580 (£100-150) whilst spending less than £60!

Another Benefit with buying an **AMD Ryzen is that they come with a stock cooler**, saving you around £20

#### 2. Motherboard
Fortunately, there are a lot of micro-ATX sized socket AM4 Motherboards that can be bought for less than £60 - Perfect for budget builds!

One of the cheapest I can recommend is the ASRock A320M-HDV which comes in at £41. However, it may be worth adding an extra £20+ to buy a motherboard with better features and capabilities for future upgrades.

> Some motherboards have better overclocking capabilities than others, so do look into that if you want to look into overclocking.
